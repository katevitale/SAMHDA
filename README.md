Substance Abuse and Mental Health Data Archive (SAMHDA) data visualization and analysis

The 'final.ipynb' program imports the Treatment Episode Data Set: Discharges (TEDS-D) from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Data Archive (SAMHDA): a collection of data about admissions to and discharges from American substance abuse treatment centers documetented in 2014 (the last year on record). The script then makes graphs to visualize various treatment measures collected.

Not all treatment episodes were documented: only admissions/discharges to state-licensed or certified treatment centers are included, and some states only report publicly-funded treatment.

In addition, data entries represent treatment episodes rather than individuals, which may therefore be represented more than once for different episodes, and there is no tracking of individuals within the data set.

For more information, see https://datafiles.samhsa.gov/study-series/treatment-episode-data-set-discharges-teds-d-nid13520.

In addition, this github repository includes a PDF "codebook" that is useful for interpreting the .csv file and data labels called "TEDS-D-2014-DS0001-info-codebook.pdf".

NOTE: .csv file is 234.3 MB.
